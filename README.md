# AlgorithmsProject

This was a project I completed for my CS404 class. You can read about the specifications of the project in pdf.
A brief summary is we want to find the path with the least "flow" between any given 2 points. For input we are given
the number of nodes and 2 matricies: one gives the distance/travel time and the other gives the flow between two nodes.
I utilized the Floyd-Warshall algorithm to find the shortest path for both of these matricies.
